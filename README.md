# AdventOfCode2015
My solutions to the problems from the 2015 [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2015) challenge website.


## General instructions for use

1. Enter the desired day's folder in your terminal
2. Locate the `input.txt` file, or the relevant line in the code file. Replace the contents with your input, or leave it as-is to run with my input. 
3. Run the `part1`, `part2`, or `dayX` file as appropriate.
   1. For `.py` files, run using `python3 <filename>.py`
   2. For `.go` files, run using `go run <filename>.go`
4. Observe output and (optionally) submit the answer to the website if you'd like to cheat ðŸ‘€.
